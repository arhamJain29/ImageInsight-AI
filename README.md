# ImageInsight-AI
ImageInsight AI is a deep learning-based image classification project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically analyze and classify images into predefined categories. Built using TensorFlow and OpenCV, this project demonstrates how AI can extract meaningful insights from visual data.

# Features
- Loads and preprocesses image datasets from directory structures.

- Implements a CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.

- Supports binary classification with real-time evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, and Accuracy.

- Cleans dataset by validating image files and removing invalid ones.

- Uses TensorBoard for interactive training visualization.

- Visualizes sample images with labels to inspect dataset quality.

# Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

- TensorFlow (Keras)

- OpenCV

- Matplotlib

- NumPy


# Getting Started

# Prerequisites
  - Python 3.x
  - Pip package manager

# Installation

pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy


# Dataset Structure
Your dataset folder should be organized like this:

- data/

  - happy/

    - image1.jpg

    - image2.jpg

    - ...

  - sad/

    - image1.jpg

    - image2.jpg

    - ...

  - ...


# Usage
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageInsight-AI.git
   cd ImageInsight-AI

2. Place your dataset inside the data folder following the structure above.

3. Run the training script:

   python train.py

4. To visualize training progress, run:

   tensorboard --logdir=logs

# Future Improvements
- Support for multi-class classification.

- Data augmentation techniques for better model generalization.

- Incorporate transfer learning for improved performance.

- Build a user-friendly interface (web or mobile).
